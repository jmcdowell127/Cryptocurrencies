# Cryptocurrencies

In this challenge I used unsupervised learning to process data, to cluster,to reduce your dimensions, and to reduce the principal components using PCA. I created an analysis for  clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. This analysis entailed creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To group the cryptocurrencies I utilized a clustering algorithm.

This assignment consisted of four techinacal analysis deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
